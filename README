# This repository contain the code to preprocess acosutic data for the CRIMAC project.

# It is slightly circular since you need to clone this repos to get the Dockerfile and
# then the dockerfile clones the repos inside the Dockerfile.

# For testing you can clone the testdata:
git clone https://github.com/nilsolav/LSSS-label-versioning
# The raw data have to be copied from pallas: /scratch/nilsolav

# Build the docker image
docker build --tag crimacwp4-preprocessing:test .

# Generate and run the container. The -v flag should point to a survey in your file
# system, and the -p flag should be the port for the jupyter-notebook.
# Two directories needs to be linked:
# \datain\ should be mapped to the data directory where the .raw, .bot and .idx files are located
% \dataout\ should be mapped to the directory where the memmap files are located
docker run -it --name pytorchacosutic -p 8989:8989 -v D:\DATA\LSSS-label-versioning\S2017838\ACOUSTIC\:/data/ -v D:\DATA\LSSS-label-versioning\S2017838\ACOUSTIC\EK60\memmap:/dataout/ crimacwp4-preprocessing:test
 
# Run notebook (inside the docker image when using the -it flag)
jupyter-notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8989 --no-browser --allow-root
