# This repository contain the code to preprocess acosutic data for the CRIMAC project.

# It is slightly circular since you need to clone this repos to get the Dockerfile and
# then the dockerfile clones the repos inside the Dockerfile.

# For testing you can clone the testdata:
git clone https://github.com/nilsolav/LSSS-label-versioning
# The raw data have to be copied from pallas: /scratch/nilsolav

# Build the matlab standalone
# Get dependencies
git clone https://github.com/nilsolav/LSSSreader/src
git clone https://github.com/nilsolav/NMDAPIreader
git clone https://github.com/nilsolav/readEKraw

# Build the docker image
docker build --tag crimacwp4-preprocessing:test .

# Generate and run the container. The -v flag should point to a survey in your file
# system, and the -p flag should be the port for the jupyter-notebook.
# Two directories needs to be linked:
# \datain\ should be mapped to the data directory where the .raw, .bot and .idx files are located
# \datawork\ should be mapped to the directory where the work files are located
# \dataout\ should be mapped to the directory where the memmap files are located
docker run -it --name pytorchacosutic -p 8989:8989 -v D:\DATA\LSSS-label-versioning\S2017838\ACOUSTIC\EK60\EK60_RAWDATA:/datain/ -v D:\DATA\LSSS-label-versioning\S2017838\ACOUSTIC\memmap:/dataout/ -v D:\DATA\LSSS-label-versioning\S2017838\ACOUSTIC\LSSS\WORK\:/datawork/ crimacwp4-preprocessing:test

# Remove the stopped container
